Following the suckless philosophy with carefully selected patches — simple, efficient, and hackable.

> Part of the [JustAGuy Linux](https://codeberg.org/justaguylinux) window manager collection.

## 📜 Suckless Philosophy

This setup adheres to the [suckless philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/):
- **Simplicity** - Minimal code, maximum functionality
- **Clarity** - Configuration through clean C header files
- **Hackability** - Easy to understand, modify, and extend

Configuration follows the suckless way: edit `config.def.h`, remove `config.h`, then recompile — no bloated config systems.

## 🚀 Installation

### Quick Install
```bash
git clone https://codeberg.org/justaguylinux/dwm-setup.git
cd dwm-setup
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Installation Options

The installer follows the suckless principle of simplicity:

```bash
./install.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --only-config      Only copy config files (perfect for non-Debian distros)
  --export-packages  Export package lists for different distros and exit
  --help            Show usage information
```

### Distribution-Agnostic Installation

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ UNSUPPORTED: Instructions for other distributions (click to expand)</strong></summary>

**IMPORTANT:** These instructions are provided as-is for advanced users. Non-Debian distributions are **NOT officially supported**. Package names and availability may vary. Use at your own risk.

**Quick Package Export:**
```bash
# Export package lists for all supported distros
./install.sh --export-packages
```

This will display properly formatted package lists for:
- Debian/Ubuntu (apt)
- Arch Linux (pacman) 
- Fedora (dnf)

**Manual Installation Process:**
1. Run `./install.sh --export-packages` to see package equivalents
2. Install the packages using your distro's package manager
3. Run `./install.sh --only-config` to copy configuration files
4. Compile and install suckless tools manually:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.config/suckless/dwm && sudo make clean install
   cd ~/.config/suckless/slstatus && sudo make clean install
   cd ~/.config/suckless/st && sudo make clean install
   cd ~/.config/suckless/tabbed && sudo make clean install
   ```

**Note:** Some packages may have different names or may not be available in all distributions. You may need to find equivalents or install from source.

</details>

### Advanced Usage Examples

```bash
# Export package lists for manual installation
./install.sh --export-packages

# Update only configuration files (no packages)
./install.sh --only-config

# Standard installation with optional tools prompt
./install.sh
```

**Note:** The script can be run from any location - it automatically detects its directory.

## 🔑 Keybindings Overview

Keybindings are split between two systems:

- `~/.config/suckless/dwm/config.def.h` for **DWM-specific keybindings** (window management, layout control, tag switching)
- `~/.config/suckless/sxhkd/sxhkdrc` for **application launchers and system commands** (programs, scripts, media keys)

This separation keeps DWM's core window management bindings in the source while allowing hot-reloadable keybinds for launching applications via sxhkd.

Launch the keybind cheatsheet anytime with:

```bash
~/.config/suckless/scripts/help
```

| Shortcut             | Action                          |

## 🗂️ Tab Management

This setup includes **suckless tabbed**, allowing you to group multiple windows into a tabbed container - similar to browser tabs but for any X11 application.

### Usage

- **`Super + T`** - Attach the focused window to a tab group
  - If no tab container exists on the current workspace, one will be created automatically
  - If a tab container already exists, the window will be added to it

- **`Super + Alt + T`** - Detach the focused window from its tab group
  - The window becomes independent again
  - Empty tab containers are automatically closed

### Navigation Within Tabs

Once windows are tabbed together, use these keys to navigate:

- **`Alt + Tab`** - Next tab
- **`Alt + Shift + Tab`** - Previous tab
- **`Alt + 1-9`** - Jump to specific tab number
- **`Alt + Q`** - Close individual tab (keeps container)

### Practical Uses

- Group multiple terminal windows together
- Keep related browser windows organized
- Manage file manager instances in one container
- Reduce window clutter on busy workspaces

## 🧱 Layouts

Select layouts using:

```text
Super + Shift + L
```

This launches a rofi menu where you can select from available layouts.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand layout descriptions</summary>

## 📜 Patch Documentation

<details>
<summary>Click to expand Patch Documenation</summary>

### 1. `dwm-alwayscenter-20200625-f04cac6.diff`
**What it does:**  
Ensures that floating windows (new ones) always appear centered on the screen.

**Why it's useful:**  
Prevents floating windows from opening at weird edges or offsets, especially useful for dialogs or apps you want neatly centered (like file pickers or floating terminal windows).

---

### 2. `dwm-attachbottom-6.3.diff`
**What it does:**  
Newly spawned windows are added at the **bottom** of the stack instead of at the top.

**Why it's useful:**  
This can help keep your active window in focus instead of being immediately pushed out when new windows are created. Provides a more "natural" stacking order for some users.

---

### 3. `dwm-cool_autostart-6.5.diff`
**What it does:**  
Adds an **autostart mechanism** to DWM without using `.xinitrc`.

**Why it's useful:**  
You can easily manage startup scripts directly in DWM’s codebase, making it more portable (especially when using login managers instead of `startx`). This patch also gracefully re-runs your autostart scripts if DWM is restarted.

---

### 4. `dwm-focusadjacenttag-6.3.diff`
**What it does:**  
Adds keybindings to **quickly switch to the next or previous tag**.

**Why it's useful:**  
Great for workflows where you spread work across multiple tags. Makes it easier to quickly switch to adjacent tags without a numeric jump.

**Usage:** Press `Control + Shift + Left/Right` to switch to adjacent tags, or `Alt + Control + Left/Right` to move windows to adjacent tags.

---

### 5. `dwm-focusedontop-6.6.diff`
**What it does:**  
Forces the currently focused floating window to always be on top.

**Why it's useful:**  
Prevents floating windows from accidentally being covered by tiled windows when they lose focus.

**[This is a patch created by Bakkeby for dwm-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/blob/master/dwm/dwm-focusedontop-6.6.diff)**

---

### 6. `dwm-focusonnetactive-6.2.diff`
**What it does:**  
Ensures DWM correctly focuses windows that request focus via _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW (like some app popups).

**Why it's useful:**  
Improves compatibility with external programs and scripts (e.g., notification popups, some dialogs, and xdg-open behavior).

---

### 7. `dwm-fullscreen-6.2.diff`
**What it does:**  
Adds the ability for windows to be **faked fullscreen**, which is basically just a borderless, statusbar-less window that fits the entire screen.

**Why it's useful:**  
Some applications (like browsers, video players, and games) expect to be able to go fullscreen. This patch allows DWM to handle fullscreen requests properly while maintaining window management control. Unlike true fullscreen modes that bypass the window manager entirely, this keeps DWM in control while giving applications the fullscreen experience they expect.

**Usage:** Press `Super + Shift + F` to toggle fullscreen mode for the focused window.

---

### 8. `dwm-movestack-20211115-a786211.diff`
**What it does:**  
Allows you to **move windows up/down the stack**.

**Why it's useful:**  
Essential for organizing windows in the master-stack layout, letting you reorder windows directly instead of closing/reopening them.

---

### 9. `dwm-pertag-20200914-61bb8b2.diff`
**What it does:**  
Each tag remembers its own **layout, master count, and gaps settings**.

**Why it's useful:**  
This is one of the most **essential DWM patches** if you use multiple tags. It allows each workspace (tag) to have its own independent configuration instead of all tags sharing the same layout.

---

### 10. `dwm-preserveonrestart-6.3.diff`
**What it does:**  
Preserves window positions when restarting DWM.

**Why it's useful:**  
Critical if you like to restart DWM to reload config changes, keeping windows in place instead of resetting them.

---

### 11. `dwm-restartsig-20180523-6.2.diff`
**What it does:**  
Adds a **restart signal handler** so you can restart DWM without logging out.

**Why it's useful:**  
Allows easy config reloads and minor changes without logging out, pairing well with `preserveonrestart`.

**Usage:** Press `Super + Shift + R` to restart DWM.

---

### 12. `dwm-namedscratchpads-6.5.diff`
**What it does:**
Implements **named scratchpads**, allowing you to create multiple independent scratchpad windows that can be toggled individually.

**Why it's useful:**
An enhanced version of the classic scratchpad feature. Unlike traditional scratchpad that only supports one window, named scratchpads let you have multiple floating windows (terminals, file managers, etc.) that can be summoned with different keybindings. Perfect for quick access to commonly used tools without cluttering your workspace.

**Usage:**
- `Super + Shift + T` - Toggle scratchpad terminal
- `Super + Shift + A` - Toggle audio mixer (pulsemixer)
- `Super + R` - Toggle ranger file manager

---

### 13. `dwm-status2d-systray-6.4.diff`
**What it does:**  
Adds support for **color-embedded status text and a systray** in DWM’s status bar.

**Why it's useful:**  
Combines two essential features:
- Colored status text for aesthetic and information clarity.
- Systray support for handling system tray icons (volume, network, etc.), which is not natively supported in DWM.

---

### 14. `dwm-sticky-6.5.diff`
**What it does:**  
Adds a "sticky" flag to windows, making them visible on all tags.

**Why it's useful:**  
Perfect for windows you want to always have accessible, like music players, system monitors, or communication apps. Sticky windows follow you across all workspaces.

**Usage:** Press `Super + S` to toggle sticky mode for the focused window.

---

### 15. `dwm-togglefloatingcenter-20210806-138b405f.diff`
**What it does:**  
Toggles a window between floating and tiled **while centering it if floating**.

**Why it's useful:**  
Combines two useful actions into one — not only toggling float, but also ensuring floating windows are neatly centered.

**Usage:** Press `Super + Shift + Space` to toggle floating/tiled mode for the focused window.

---

### 16. `dwm-vanitygaps-6.2.diff`
**What it does:**  
Adds support for **customizable outer and inner gaps** between windows.

**Why it's useful:**  
Essential for those who like cleaner layouts with space between windows. Especially good for aesthetic "rice" setups.

---

### 17. `dwm-windowfollow-20221002-69d5652.diff`
**What it does:**  
Makes it so that when you move a window to another tag, DWM will **follow you to that tag**.

**Why it's useful:**  
Enhances workflow — instead of moving a window to another tag and then manually switching to that tag, DWM follows automatically.
